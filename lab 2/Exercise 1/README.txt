Exercise 2
1. Use a double-subscripted array to solve the following problem. A company has five sales-people (1 to 5) who sell four different products (1 to 4). Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip for each different type of product sold. Each slip contains the following:
a) the salesperson number
b) the product number
c) the total dollar value of that product sold that day
Thus, each salesperson passes in between 0 and 4 slips per day. Assume that the information from all of the slips for the last month is available. Write a program that will read all this information for last monthâ€™s sales and summarize the total sales by salesperson by product. All totals should be stored in the double-subscripted array sales. After processing all the information for the last month, print the results in tabular format with each of the columns representing a particular salesperson and each of the row representing a particular product. Cross total each row now to get the total sales of each product for last month; cross total each  column to get the total sales by salesperson for last month. Your tabular printout should  include these cross totals to the right  of the totaled rows and to the bottom of the totaled columns.
Remark: Consider a method for entering data (e.g. you can generate random values and save them in a file) and the way of presenting the results.
