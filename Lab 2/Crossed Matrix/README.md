A company has five sales-people (1 to 5) who sell four different products (1 to 4). 

Once a day, each salesperson passes in a slip in the follwing format:
a) the salesperson number
b) the product number
c) the total dollar value of that product sold that day

Assume the information from all last month is available on a file. 
(Optional: implement a function to generate random values for the slips and store them on a file)

Cross total each row now to get the total sales of each product for last month
